## Introduction

### what is a virtual machine ?
 - A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.
 - It enables you to run multiple operating systems (OS) or instances of the same OS on a single physical machine, known as the host machine.

### What is SSH ?
 - SSH stands for Secure Shell, which is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers by establishing a secure connection. It's commonly used for remote access to systems, file transfers, and executing commands on a remote machine.

### TCP vs UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for transmitting data over networks, but they have different characteristics and are suited for different purposes.
 - TCP:
    TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets between devices.
    Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection between two devices before data transfer begins.
    Slower but More Reliable.
 - UDP:
    UDP does not establish a connection before transmitting data and does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or error-checking of data packets.
    Faster, Lower Overhead.
